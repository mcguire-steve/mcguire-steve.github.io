Steve McGuire is a Graduate Research Assistant in the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a NASA Space Technology Research Fellow, his research explores how autonomous systems can improve their fault recovery strategies by learning about the humans that might be available to help. He has worked with robotic systems since his undergraduate internship at NASA Ames' Intelligent Robotics Group in 2001, earning his BS in Computer Engineering from Penn State in 2003 and subsequently competing in the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004. After a career in the United States Marine Corps as a helicopter pilot, he served as lead avionics engineer for a Google Lunar X Prize competitor before returning to school to pursue his PhD in Aerospace Engineering. He is currently pursuing postdoc opportunities.
